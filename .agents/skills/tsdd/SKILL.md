  Test-Spec Driven Development (TSDD): tests are the durable specification, TDD is the operating discipline, prose carries only Why, and `AGENTS.md` stays a navigation map. Load before production code, tests, ADRs, architectural decisions, `AGENTS.md` edits, or any durable prose artifact that would duplicate tests or code. Also load when the user asks to write tests or define test behavior before implementation, including "test 書いて", "test 書いて", "テスト書いて", "pytest", "テスト環境", "TSDD", "Test-Spec Driven Development", "TDD で実装", "ADR を書いて", "decision record", or "executable specification".

# Test-Spec Driven Development (TSDD)

## Scope

This skill governs the **methodology layer** of day-to-day coding work — how requirements, design decisions, and implementation are recorded and evolved, and in what order work proceeds. It is deliberately language-agnostic.

TSDD means the test suite is the durable specification. TDD is the operating discipline used to grow that specification one executable example at a time.

Out of scope and delegated elsewhere:

- Language-specific conventions (mock libraries, fixture patterns, lint rules, assertion style, package manager commands, module layout) → the relevant `*-style` skill and `rules/coding_guideline.md`.
- Project and CI bootstrap (flake, direnv, language init, CI workflow scaffolding) → the relevant `*-init` skill.

If a rule below starts feeling like a language-specific implementation detail, it belongs in one of those skills, not here.

## Core Principle

**The spec is the test suite. Prose documents carry only Why.**

Natural-language specification documents become a second source of truth that drifts from the code, violates DRY, and doubles the cost of every requirement change. Under this methodology, requirements live inside executable tests, implementation is self-documenting via code and types, and the only human-written prose captures _why_ a decision was made — which code cannot express anyway, so no duplication occurs.

### Why this matters especially for AI coding agents

An AI agent's bottleneck is not typing speed. It is distinguishing "my output is correct" from "my output looks plausible." Executable specs give the agent an objective pass/fail signal that natural-language specs cannot provide. Tests fail when the agent hallucinates an API, types reject invalid states at compile time, and ADRs keep the agent from unknowingly reversing a past decision. Remove any one of these layers and the agent's autonomy degrades to plausibility checking.

## Information Placement Matrix

Every artifact in the codebase has exactly one of four homes. If the same information appears in two homes, delete it from the wrong one — do not "sync" them.

| Layer                    | Lives in                                                                                | Role                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What** (requirements)  | Tests                                                                                   | Executable specification. Cannot drift from code because it is executed against code.               |
| **How** (implementation) | Code + types                                                                            | Self-documenting via naming, structure, Value Objects, and type constraints.                        |
| **Why** (decisions)      | ADR under `docs/adr/` for broad / architectural Why; inline code comments for local Why | Both carry rationale that code cannot express. They differ in scope (see "ADR vs inline comments"). |
| **Navigation**           | `AGENTS.md`                                                                             | Entry map for the AI agent. Points to the other layers; never copies them.                          |

**Anti-patterns**:

- A durable prose artifact that restates what the tests or code already say. Delete it; let the tests be the spec.
- A living document that is expected to be kept in sync with behavior or implementation. It will not be. Write tests and code instead.

**Exception**: in heavily regulated domains (medical device, safety-critical, finance with audit obligation) a natural-language spec may be legally required. In that case keep it, but treat the tests as the _authoritative_ spec and the document as a derivative that the tests cross-check.

## Transient Natural-Language Planning

Natural language is allowed as temporary working memory. It is often useful before the next executable example is clear, especially when decomposing a vague request, listing candidate behaviors, sketching edge cases, or comparing possible cuts through the problem.

The constraint is lifetime and authority: planning prose must never become an authoritative artifact in the repository. It may live in the chat, a scratchpad, or a temporary TODO while the work is being shaped, but it must be resolved before the task is finished.

Before finishing, every planning note must be converted into exactly one appropriate durable home:

- A requirement or observable behavior → an executable test with a full-sentence name.
- A domain invariant → a type, Value Object, parser, or boundary validation.
- An implementation detail → code whose names and structure make the detail clear.
- A broad rationale or rejected alternative → an ADR.
- A local rationale for a non-obvious line or block → an inline code comment.
- Navigation for future agents → a pointer in `AGENTS.md`.
- Anything else → delete it.

Do not record scratchpads or TODO lists as durable project artifacts to preserve planning prose. If the prose still feels necessary after implementation, it is a signal that it has not yet been moved to the correct layer.

## TDD Operating Discipline

Follow Kent Beck's Red → Green → Refactor, one test at a time. The rhythm is non-negotiable because breaking it is the single most common way AI agents regress into "write a pile of code, then bolt on tests."

### Per-cycle rules

1. **Write one failing test.** Not three. Not ten. One.
2. **Run the verification gate and confirm the new test fails for the expected reason.** Prefer the full suite. If the repo is large or already has unrelated failures, first establish the baseline, then run the narrowest suite that proves the new executable spec is Red without hiding known failures.
3. **Write the minimum code to pass.** Obvious implementation if the path is clear; "fake it" (hardcode the answer) or triangulate with a second example if it is not.
4. **Run the verification gate and confirm Green.** Prefer the full suite; otherwise run the narrow suite plus the project's agreed quality gates, and explicitly report any pre-existing failures that remain.
5. **Refactor with the suite green.** Remove duplication, rename for clarity, extract functions / types. Re-run the suite after each small change.
6. **Record the change as one coherent VCS unit.** Commit each Red → Green → Refactor cycle so it remains reviewable as one logical unit.

### Test quality rules (methodology-level)

Only rules that are part of the development methodology live here. Mocking libraries, fixture patterns, assertion styles, coverage tooling — those are language-specific and belong in the relevant `*-style` skill.

- **Test name = requirement sentence.** The name is a human-readable statement of the behavior being verified. `test_registering_with_empty_password_raises_validation_error` is a spec line; `test_1`, `test_user_ok`, `test_happy_path` are not. Treat the name as the specification channel — wasting it loses the whole point of executable specs.
- **Expected outcome first.** Decide the observable outcome before arrange and act. When the language and framework make it natural, write the assertion first; otherwise keep the test shaped around the expected behavior, not around convenient setup.
- **One concept per test.** If the test name needs the word "and", split the test.
- **Do not re-test what the type system already guarantees.** If a parameter is `NonEmptyString`, do not write `test_empty_string_rejected` on every consumer — the constructor already enforces it. Test the invariant once, at the boundary where it is created.

### AI-specific failure modes and their guards

| Failure mode                                                        | Guard                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent writes implementation first, then bolts on tests              | TDD-enforcing workflow / wrapper command; state in `AGENTS.md` that production code without a corresponding failing-then-passing test is a defect |
| Agent writes many tests all Red and then batch-implements           | Rule: at most one Red test at a time. If you catch yourself queuing more, delete them and reintroduce them one cycle at a time                    |
| Agent writes generic test names (`test_success`, `test_case_1`)     | Require full-sentence names describing the observable behavior; reject PRs otherwise                                                              |
| Agent skips the Refactor step because tests are green               | Treat Refactor as a mandatory third phase, not an optional cleanup. List it explicitly in `AGENTS.md` alongside Red and Green                     |
| Agent writes a test for behavior the type system already guarantees | Review test diffs against type signatures; delete redundant coverage                                                                              |
| Agent writes durable prose "to plan the feature"                    | Plan in a scratchpad or the chat; once planning ends, encode the plan as tests. Do not record planning prose as a durable project artifact        |

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Operation

ADRs are the only long-form human-prose documents in this methodology. They exist because code and tests cannot express "why this choice and not the alternative" or "what was already rejected and why."

### Layout

```
docs/
└── adr/
    ├── 0001-record-architecture-decisions.md   # The meta-ADR: why we use ADRs at all
    ├── 0002-<decision-kebab-case>.md
    └── 0003-<decision-kebab-case>.md
```

### Rules

- **One decision per file.** Appending to a single file destroys the supersession chain and kills searchability.
- **Sequential four-digit IDs.** Never reuse or delete — the history is the point.
- **Past ADRs are immutable.** To reverse a decision, write a new ADR with `Supersedes: ADR-NNNN` and flip the old one's `Status` to `Superseded`.
- **Status values**: `Proposed` | `Accepted` | `Superseded` | `Deprecated`.
- **Record ADRs with the code change they justify.** ADR and code travel in the same commit.

### Preferred format: Y-Statement

Writing burden kills ADR adoption. The Y-Statement template collapses a full ADR into a single five-part sentence:

```
In the context of <use case / situation>,
facing <concern or forcing function>,
we decided for <chosen option> and against <alternatives considered>,
to achieve <quality or benefit gained>,
accepting <downside or cost incurred>.
```

Wrap it with minimal metadata. Example:

```markdown
# ADR-0003: Authentication mechanism

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-04-01

In the context of a web-only service with moderate concurrent load,
facing the need to balance implementation simplicity against future extensibility,
we decided for Cookie-based server-side sessions and against JWT,
to achieve minimal library dependencies and explicit CSRF handling,
accepting that a future mobile roll-out will require a superseding ADR and a token-based scheme.
```

If a decision is large enough that Y-Statement feels cramped, fall back to the longer template (`Context` / `Decision` / `Alternatives Considered` / `Consequences`). Do **not** use the long template by default — the friction suppresses recording, and an unrecorded decision is worse than a terse one.

### When to write an ADR

Write one whenever a future reader (including future-you or a fresh AI agent) might ask "why did they do it this way instead of the obvious alternative?" Typical triggers:

- Picking a library / framework / database / protocol when real alternatives existed.
- Choosing an architectural pattern (sessions vs tokens, monolith vs service split, sync vs event-driven, server-rendered vs SPA).
- Adopting a constraint not self-evident from the code (e.g. "no runtime dependencies beyond the standard library").
- Reversing a previous decision.
- Rejecting a commonly-expected pattern for a project-specific reason.

Do **not** write one for:

- Trivial local code choices (that is what a one-line code comment is for).
- Re-statements of language or framework defaults.
- Anything a code reader can infer from the code in under a minute.

### ADR vs inline code comments

They are complementary, not competing, forms of Why.

- **Inline comment** — Why _this specific line or block_ is the way it is. Local, narrow, moves and dies with the code.
- **ADR** — Why the broader approach was chosen. Spans files, survives refactors, carries the rejected alternatives.

Rule of thumb: if the same Why would have to be pasted into three different files' comments, it belongs in an ADR. If it applies to a single tricky line, it belongs inline.

## Type-Driven Design

Types carry compile-time invariants and constraints. They are not a second source of truth for requirements; they make invalid states unrepresentable so tests and runtime checks do not have to repeat those constraints.

### Patterns (naming is language-dependent — see the relevant `*-style` skill for idiomatic forms)

- **Value Objects** wrap primitives with domain constraints. `UserId`, `Email`, `PositiveInt`, `NonEmptyString` instead of raw `str` / `int`. Construct through a validating constructor; keep fields immutable.
- **Branded / newtype types** to prevent mixing structurally-identical but semantically-distinct values (e.g. `UserId` and `OrderId` are both `string` but should not be interchangeable).
- **Result / Either types** for operations that can fail. Forces the caller to handle both arms. Avoid throwing for expected failures.
- **Exhaustive sum types** for state machines. The compiler catches unhandled cases when a new variant is added.
- **Parse, don't validate.** Validation at the boundary turns raw input into a constrained type; once inside, the type guarantees correctness and downstream code stops re-checking.

### Interaction with tests

A test that only verifies what the type already guarantees is noise. Examples:

- Type is `NonEmptyString` → the constructor test covers emptiness; consumers do not need `test_empty_string_rejected`.
- Enum with exhaustive match → no need for `test_unknown_variant_raises`; the compiler forbids it.
- Return type is `Result<T, E>` → no need for `test_does_not_throw` on the happy path.

Tests should cover behavior the type system cannot express: business rules, ordering, side effects, interaction with external systems.

## `AGENTS.md` as the Agent's Entry Map

`AGENTS.md` is the only document guaranteed to load into every task's context. Keep it a map, not a textbook. It should be read in under a minute.

### What belongs

- One-paragraph project summary (what, for whom, why it exists).
- One-line-per-top-level-directory layout intent.
- Coding conventions — or, preferably, pointers to the relevant `*-style` skill.
- Workflow rules phrased as invariants: "TDD is mandatory; production code without a failing-then-passing test is a defect", "ADR required for architectural decisions", "keep each green refactor as one reviewable VCS unit".
- Explicit prohibitions: "do not push without user instruction", "do not create durable prose that duplicates tests or code".
- A pointer to `docs/adr/` as a resource to consult **on demand** when a decision-relevant topic arises. Do **not** auto-load the entire ADR directory into every task — it will bloat context as ADRs accumulate.

### What does not belong

- The actual list of requirements (those live in tests).
- Implementation details (those live in code).
- Decision rationales (those live in ADRs).
- Anything that needs to be edited every time a feature ships.

If `AGENTS.md` grows past roughly 200 lines it has started duplicating another layer. Audit and extract.

## Enforcement Mechanisms

A methodology that relies on the agent remembering to follow it will drift. Build guardrails that make the right path the default:

- **TDD-enforcing workflow / wrapper command** that refuses to advance to implementation until the new executable spec is Red for the expected reason.
- **CI gates**: tests pass; type checker clean.
- **PR template** with checkboxes: "New tests added or updated?", "ADR added or superseded?", "No durable prose duplicated tests or code?".
- **`AGENTS.md`** points to `docs/adr/` as a consulting resource (read on demand), not a bulk-load target.

## Agent self-check before finishing a task

1. Is there a test that fails for the expected reason without my change and passes with it? If no → not done.
2. Is the test name a sentence a product owner could read as a requirement? If no → rename.
3. Did I introduce an architectural choice not already covered by an ADR? If yes → write one in Y-Statement form.
4. Did I create durable prose that duplicates tests or code? If yes → delete it; move content into tests, ADR, or `AGENTS.md` as appropriate.
5. Did I leave transient planning prose in the repository? If yes → convert it to the correct durable home or delete it.
6. Did I write a test for behavior the type system already guarantees? If yes → delete it.
7. Is `AGENTS.md` still a map, or has it started duplicating another layer? If duplicating → prune.
8. Did I skip the Refactor step because everything is green? If yes → return to it.

## Interaction with other skills

- **`*-style` (`python-style`, `bash-style`, `gha-style`, ...)** — language-specific conventions. This skill sits on top of them; both are usually loaded together when implementing.
- **`*-init` (`nix-dev-init`, `github-ci-init`)** — project and CI bootstrap. Runs _before_ this skill applies; this skill governs the code written _inside_ the bootstrapped project.

## Summary

Tests are the specification. Code and types are the design. ADRs carry the reasoning. Inline comments carry local reasoning. `AGENTS.md` is the map. Everything else is duplication waiting to rot — resist the instinct to write it.
